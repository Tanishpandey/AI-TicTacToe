**AIticTacToe** is an AI-powered implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The application allows users to play against a computer opponent, where the AI makes optimal moves using a decision-making algorithm. The goal of the project is to demonstrate the use of algorithms for creating intelligent game opponents.
